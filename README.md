# üßæ Inventory Management System

## üìå Project Overview

The **Inventory Management System** is a role-based backend application designed to help organizations manage stock efficiently. It provides secure and structured functionality for tracking products, categories, and stock levels with real-time inventory logs.

Built with scalability and accountability in mind, the system supports two roles:

- **Admin** ‚Äì full access to users, categories, and inventory
- **Staff** ‚Äì limited to managing product stock and viewing data

Key features include:

- Product CRUD operations
- Category & subcategory classification
- Automatic inventory logging for stock actions (add, remove, update)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Slug-based and ID-based route access
- Low-stock threshold monitoring

The system is suitable for use in **warehouses, medical stores, retail shops, and internal inventory tracking**.
